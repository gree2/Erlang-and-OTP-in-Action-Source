To build this code, run the following commands (or run compile.sh):

erlc -o ./tcp_interface/ebin ./tcp_interface/src/*.erl
erlc -o ./gen_web_server/ebin ./gen_web_server/src/*.erl
erlc -o ./restful_interface/ebin ./restful_interface/src/*.erl
erlc -o ./simple_cache/ebin ./simple_cache/src/*.erl
erlc -o ./resource_discovery/ebin ./resource_discovery/src/*.erl

Start the simple_cache system as in chapter 10 (including a contact node),
but also include the path to tcp_interface/ebin:

erl -sname contact1 -detached
erl -sname mynode -pa ./tcp_interface/ebin -pa ./simple_cache/ebin -pa ./resource_discovery/ebin/ -boot ./simple_cache -config sys

(The node discovery waits a few seconds at startup.)

Then, from the Erlang shell, run:

application:start(tcp_interface).

You can now e.g. run appmon:start() to inspect the system and check that
tcp_interface is running alongside the other applications.

After that, open another terminal window and use telnet
to connect to the application, like this:

$ telnet localhost 1055
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain.
Escape character is '^]'.
lookup[foo]
OK:{error,not_found}.
insert[foo,bar]
OK:ok.
lookup[foo]
OK:{ok,bar}.
delete[foo]
OK:ok.
lookup[foo]
OK:{error,not_found}.
