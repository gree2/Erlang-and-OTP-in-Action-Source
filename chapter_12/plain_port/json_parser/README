To build the Erlang code, run the following command:

erlc -o ./ebin ./src/*.erl

To build the C code using gcc, run the following:

gcc -o ./priv/parser -I$(OTPROOT)/lib/erl_interface-3.6.5/include -I$(YAJLROOT)/include -L$(OTPROOT)/lib/erl_interface-3.6.5/lib -L$(YAJLROOT)/lib ./c_src/parser.c -lerl_interface_st -lei_st -lyajl

OTPROOT is typically /usr/lib/erlang. Check what your version of
erl_interface is and that the include and lib directories exist and contain
the expected header files and library files - not all Erlang distributions
ship these development files in the basic installation package. YAJLROOT is
wherever your YAJL installation is. If you built YAJL but did not do 'make
install', this will be something like lloyd-yajl-1.0.9-0/build/yajl-1.0.9/.

To run the program, first start Erlang like this:

erl -pa ./ebin

Then, run the following in the Erlang shell:

1> application:start(json_parser).
ok
2>
